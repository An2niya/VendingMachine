# Secured Transaction through multiple approval

The contract was changed from a vending machine contract to a contract that secures transaction through multiple approval by different wallet address. When i was creating this i had a company scenerio in mind. In a company, say a new idea or initiative was to be assumed or made to take effect, it has to pass through due process, it will most definitely go through production manager then accountant and then finally the ceo and once the ceo has signed off on it, you can go ahead and make those  intiative

In this smart contract, you can create the minimum amount of users that can approve smart contract transaction and those transaction always emits events so that they can be logged and subscribed to.
